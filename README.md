# Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Project-2020<br>
Contains the project for 52446 Project 2020. Create by Donal Maher G00387895 Data analysis student. 
project outline.<br>
In this project you must perform and explain simple linear regression polynominal linear regression and Multiple Linear regression using Python.<br<>
And, do some minor comparsion to some other regression methods.<br>
The powerproduction dataset available at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ianmcloughlin/2020A-machstat-project/master/dataset/powerproduction.csv. <br>The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis.<br>
The second dataset is located in this repository called powerproduction_MultiSpeeds.csv this is an created dataset to explore mulitpule linear regression. <br>
